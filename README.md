# SwiftyRefresh

`SwiftyRefresh` is a bare bones Swift implementation of the very popular pull-to-refresh functionality. Subclass your UITableView, implement the single delegate method, and you're set!

## Requirements

`SwiftyRefresh` uses Swift and ARC and requires iOS 8.0+. Works for iPhone and iPad.

## Installation

### Manual

Copy the folder `Copy These` to your project.

## Usage

The pull-to-refresh only takes a few lines to add to your view controller. You can directly customize the functionality in the superclass file if you wish. See the example project for implementation instructions.
